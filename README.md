# RenderSmoothing

This is a 1.19.2 fabric mod which is designed to smooth out camera rotation movement between ticks.

Since 1.13.2 Minecraft no longer smoothes out the rotations, thus leading to a jumpy camera when using client side mods such as Baritone or AltoClef, this is designed to fix these issues.

When using with baritone make sure to set `randomLooking113` and `randomLooking` to `0` for the smoothest view.

If you want this to be ported to a different version please get in touch with me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/586743480651350063).
