# RenderSmoothing

This is a 1.18.2 fabric mod which is designed to smooth out camera rotation movement between ticks.

Since 1.13.2 Minecraft no longer smoothes out the rotations, thus leading to a jumpy camera when using client side mods such as baritone or altoclef, this is designed to fix these issues.

If you want this to be ported to a different version please get in touch with me on discord (scorbett123#5313).
